#TODO
 * Use args.slice to combine input and remove the need to have to actually quote entries.
 * Figure out a way to represent bang/! without triggering the history command for bash.
 * Potentially implement a subset of the markdown commands? Or just accept full markdown via plugin?
   * The `@` sign has no significance in Markdown (I think)

#Thoughts/Thinking out loud
 * Add a new escape character to tag twitter names (@@).
   * `>> journal @@robwett is the absolute worst. @terriblepeople"
