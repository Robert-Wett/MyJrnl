#journal-cli

#####write random things, thoughts, blogs, or whatever with the CLI app backed by firebase with an angular front-end, inspired by [jrnl](http://maebert.github.io/jrnl/). Because there's no backend needed, you can host this on the github project page [as I do here](http://robert-wett.github.io/journal). This is a work in progress!
